## 📌 About Me

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence for healthcare, with a strong focus on medical image analysis and explainable AI. I am currently an invited PhD researcher at **CRIL (UMR 8188)**, working on Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for interpretable medical imaging. My research aims to bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning models and clinically meaningful decision support systems. I have published my work in recognized international conferences, including AIME 2025 and IEEE AICCSA 2024.

**Research Focus**
My current research focuses on interpretable medical imaging using Concept Bottleneck Models, with particular interest in concept-based representations and clinically grounded explanations.

**Career Objective**
I am actively seeking an ATER (Attaché Temporaire d’Enseignement et de Recherche) position to further develop my research in interpretability and explainable AI, while contributing to academic teaching. I am highly motivated to teach courses in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and AI for healthcare, and to share my research experience with the next generation of students.
An ATER position would allow me to strengthen my academic pedagogy and build a solid academic career in France, within a research and teaching environment in which I am highly motivated to contribute.
