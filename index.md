## 👤 Research Profile

Doctoral researcher specializing in interpretable deep learning for medical imaging, with focus on vision transformers and explainable AI. Published first-author papers at AIME 2025 and IEEE AICCSA 2024. Teaching experience: 63h of TD/TP in AI, machine learning, and computer vision, delivered in French and English at university level through an academic training project. Currently co-supervising 3 Master's students in medical imaging and NLP research.

**Research Focus**

My current research focuses on developing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for interpretable medical imaging, with particular emphasis on creating clinician-verifiable reasoning systems that bridge high-performance deep learning with explainable clinical decision support.

**Career Objective**

I am actively seeking an ATER (Attaché Temporaire d'Enseignement et de Recherche) position to further develop my research in interpretability and explainable AI while contributing to academic teaching. I am highly motivated to teach courses in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and AI for healthcare, sharing my research experience with the next generation of students. An ATER position would allow me to strengthen my academic pedagogy and build a solid academic career in France within a research and teaching environment.
